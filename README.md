# OldLoadTestingJustice
This is archived code written to load test the Scotland Centralized Justice servers as a part of user acceptance testing. It will not run in its current format as it needs to be pointed at the CJ website specifically. One day this could be generalized to work with any site, but this was for work and now I am just archiving it.
